  <h2>üåê What is Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning?</h2>
  <p>
    Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning is a class of algorithms that use graph structures to represent the relationships or similarities between data points, both labeled and unlabeled.  
    The idea is to propagate label information smoothly over the graph, assuming that connected or similar nodes are likely to share the same label.
  </p>

  <h2>üìö Detailed Concept</h2>
  <p>
    In graph-based methods, data points are represented as nodes in a graph, and edges indicate similarity or affinity between points (often weighted by a similarity function).  
    The label information is propagated from labeled nodes to unlabeled ones through edges, often by minimizing an energy function that enforces label smoothness on the graph.  
    This leverages the geometric structure of data and the cluster assumption: points in the same cluster tend to have the same label.
  </p>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Types of Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Label Propagation:</strong> Labels are spread iteratively from labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes based on graph connectivity until convergence.</li>
    <li><strong>Label Spreading:</strong> Similar to label propagation but with normalization to ensure stability and better handling of noisy labels.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Regularization Methods:</strong> Combine supervised loss with a smoothness term on the graph Laplacian to encourage similar nodes to have similar labels.</li>
    <li><strong>Manifold Regularization:</strong> Extends graph regularization by incorporating manifold assumptions in the learning process, improving generalization.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):</strong> Use neural networks to learn node embeddings that capture graph structure and labels, enabling semi-supervised learning in complex graphs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üöÄ Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Social network analysis for community detection and influence prediction.</li>
    <li>Image and video segmentation where pixels or regions are nodes in a graph.</li>
    <li>Recommendation systems using user-item interaction graphs.</li>
    <li>Bioinformatics for predicting protein functions or gene interactions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚úÖ Advantages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Effectively exploits the underlying data geometry and relationships.</li>
    <li>Can handle complex data distributions that are not easily separable.</li>
    <li>Leverages both labeled and abundant unlabeled data efficiently.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Construction of a meaningful graph and choice of similarity measures are critical and can be challenging.</li>
    <li>Scalability can be an issue for very large datasets due to graph size.</li>
    <li>Performance sensitive to noisy or incorrect edges in the graph.</li>
